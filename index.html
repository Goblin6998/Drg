<h2>Game overview</h2>
<br>
<p class="p">Rock and stone? Rock and stone, brother.

Man, it's been a while since I've played something with so much soul and love put into it. And by "soul and love", I mean the devs seemed to have such a blast while making this thing, just as much as we do when playing it.

A simple gameplay loop of mining rocks, killing bugs, and ordering supply drops really has no right of being this fun. But it is carried by a vast amount of player loadout options, witfully designed low-poly aesthetic graphics, delicious sound design, amazing gunplay feel, cute features that are there just to add into the player's fun experience, and very funny voice lines (from both dwarves and Mission Control).

Actually, now that I think about it, this game unironically reminds me of Left 4 Dead, while both have quite different gameplay loops and visual-styles, both are simple enough to be fun on their own but are carried by the personality, love, and care that the devs put into it, which just absolutely sells me on it.

The only DLC available for this game are cosmetics, with the actual gameplay-related updates being FREE, and base game cosmetics and weapon upgrades being available by just playing the game. A breath of fresh air considering the amount of AAA releases that are pricey, unfinished, untested, unpolished, souless, microtransaction filled catastrophes (On a related note, Overkill and Payday 3 can go burn in hell).

The only negative I can say about the game is that it sometimes can feel like RNG hell (the caves ARE procedurally-generated, after all), but even that doesn't bother me THAT much (which is saying a lot coming from a man that DESPISES the cruel mistress that is RNG).

Y'all know the meme with Martin Scorsese's fake quote saying "This is cinema"? Unironically me about DRG, but instead of "This is cinema", it is "This is videogames".</p>

<h2>The Characters/Classes</h2>
<div class="text">
<ul>
<li>Gunners are one of the best characters in the game especially in single player mode but also a really good team mate.</li>
<li>Scouts are very cool little guys they play more of a leaders role and for the people who have mained scout have said atleast once "my platforms prevent fall damage." .</li>
<li>Engineers are also pretty cool guys everyone who has played as the engineer can say it's enjoyable yet challenging.</li>
<li>Now Drillers are the gigachads or sigma males of the dwarven world they are the best at what they do, mining.</li>
</ul>
